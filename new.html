          You know that feeling when you get when you think everyone doesn't care about you and that you're all alone? It's ok to feel like that, so many other people feel like that and you're not utterly alone like your brain leads you to believe. You're ok, you're allowed to grieve and feel pain, and all those emotions that rage inside that beautiful head of yours. But at the end of the day, you want to know something? Some of those friends that you wanted to invite you out is probably suffering from the same thing. So put yourself out there, yes it may seem scary but

it's ok to crawl before you walk,
Happy Rose day ðŸŒ¹
